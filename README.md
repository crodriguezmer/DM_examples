# crgitdemo
This repository is a work in progress. 
Its primary motivation is to share scripts among labmates and others doing decision making research.
As an added bonus, the scripts can be a conversation topic.
Eventually this repository will include behavior, eeg, and fmri directories containing examples of data analysis
pipelines in matlab, R, and python.
